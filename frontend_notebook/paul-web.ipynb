    "## Introduction to Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks are a staple in any data scientist's toolkit. It is a free, open source, interactive data science environment that can function as both an IDE and a visualisation tool. A Jupyter Notebook is a single document where you can run code, display the output and add equations and explainations. Each notebook is a `.ipynb` file, which is a text file that describes the content of the notebook in JSON format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each Jupter Notebook contains a kernal that can be thought of as a \"computational engine\" that executes the code within the notebook. Notebooks are made up of a number of cells. For example, this piece of text you are reading resides in the first cell of this notebook. They can be markdown cells that display text in-place or code cells. When a code cell is run, the output is displayed below the cell. The order in which cells are run matters! Cells containing functions or variables have to be run before those same functions or variables can be called from a subsequent cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "How to use a Jupyter Notebook:\n",
    "- To run a cell, either click the arrow to the left of the cell or press `ctrl + Enter` after selecting the cell. When a cell is run, a number will appear in square brackets (e.g. [1]) telling you the order in which each cell is run.\n",
    "- To interrupt a cell while it is running, press the button with the black square in the toolbar at the top\n",
    "- To restart the kernal, right-click `kernel` and choose from the list of restart options available\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Plotly\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is an open source library providing data structure and data analysis tools for the Python language. Plotly is another open source that allows you to put together high quality graphs to faciliate the visualisation of the data. Plotly Dash (written on top of Plotly.js and React.js) allows one to quickly build data apps that are rendered in the browser. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains examples of how each of these libraries can be leveraged to analyse and visualise data. For more information, please check out the official documentation listed below.\n",
